Cross Validated(stat.stack.exchange) is a question and answer site for people interested in statistics, machine learning, data analysis, data mining, and data visualization. This is a machine learning project to mine this "Cross Validated" dataset. There is trememdous value to explore this Stack Exchange dataset to analyze the user behaviors, which can improve the organization of the site. We are interested in working on the following possible problems:

- Topic modeling and graph visualization
- predicting(classifying) the quality of a question post 
- predicting(classifying) the quality of a answer post 
- predicting whether the answers would be duplicated/deleted at the creation time for a
postNot (not yet tried)
